00:00:00.014 --> 00:00:02.597
(upbeat music)

00:00:07.726 --> 00:00:11.510
- Hi, everyone. Danny here
from freelancetowin.com.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.950
And today I'm going to
be talking to you about

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.370
the elements of a winning
proposal in 2021 and beyond.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.910
Now, this is a very exciting topic for me.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.270
It's one of my favorite
things to talk about

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.350
because I believe that being
able to write great proposals

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.240
is absolutely key to
your success on Upwork.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.830
Now, first and foremost,

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.090
let's briefly go over

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.110
what you're going to learn
in this presentation.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.140
One, I'll show you how to stand out

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.500
and get clients to notice your proposal,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.410
even if you're new to Upwork.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.800
Two, you'll also learn how to show clients

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.560
you're a good fit for their project.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.040
And again, that's even if you're
a beginner here on Upwork.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.960
Three, how to position yourself

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.620
as an authority on the
type of work you're doing,

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.940
including those of you

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.150
who may not have a big portfolio just yet.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.670
Four, I'll show you how to

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.260
expertly answer screening questions.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.810
And if you're still new to Upwork

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.970
and you aren't quite sure what those are,

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.890
don't worry, I'll be explaining that too.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.030
And finally, I'll even
show you some next steps

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.030
that will help you put
this knowledge into action.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.890
All right, we're about to get into it,

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.630
but first real quick, for those
of you who may not know me,

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.390
here's a brief overview of my work.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.920
I've personally earned

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.270
hundreds of thousands of
dollars here on Upwork,

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.860
including over $100,000 in just 12 months.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.530
And I don't say that to brag,

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.440
but just to let you know that
I'm no stranger to this stuff.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.570
My work has also been featured
by many major publications,

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.820
including Inc, Bloomberg and many others.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.940
I also have a popular blog
called Freelance To Win

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.840
where I share Upwork related
strategies and tips with

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.190
hundreds of thousands
of freelancers each year

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.000
from all over the world and
from different backgrounds,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.100
industries and experience levels.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.090
So I really believe that these
strategies I'm gonna show you

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.910
will be widely applicable.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:01.743
I'm a writer,

00:02:01.743 --> 00:02:05.030
yet these strategies
properly applied and adopted

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.590
can be effective in any work category.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.580
Okay, so given that this talk is about

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.930
how to write a winning
proposal in 2021 and beyond,

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.300
let's talk briefly about

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.610
what we can expect in 2021 and beyond.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.420
Well, it's a safe bet to assume

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.980
that clients will be
busier than ever before.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.140
We also know clients today
have unprecedented choices

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.130
when it comes to hiring freelancers.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.140
There are more people freelancing
right now than ever before

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.160
and we can expect that
trend to continue as well.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.880
And finally, when it comes
to hiring freelancers,

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.380
clients have higher expectations
than they did in the past.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.490
How do we know that?

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.810
Because as people are given more choices,

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.000
they also begin to naturally expect

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.290
better results from those choices.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.750
This is sometimes known
as the paradox of choice.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.570
Now, and this is very important,

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.820
there's also a tremendous
upside to these trends

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.000
because there are also
more clients, more projects

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.140
and more excellent
opportunities than ever before,

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.560
including more opportunities for us

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.820
to stand out and impress clients.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.740
And I believe the best way to do that

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.700
is with a powerful, succinct proposal.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.010
One of the best things about

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.440
the approaches I'm going
to show you is that

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.200
they're fairly easy to learn and implement

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.700
as some approaches that used to work well

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.040
may not be as effective going forward,

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.440
again, given the unprecedented level

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.550
of busyness and expectations
clients now have.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:29.900
Now, in the next slide,

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.740
we're going to get right into it

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.580
and I'll show you how I
actually write proposals.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.820
But first, in order for
it to make the most sense,

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.840
I want to set some context for you.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.920
So here you can see my
big picture game plan

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.070
because my proposal isn't just a proposal,

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.220
it's actually a part of
an overall process I have

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.180
for acquiring new clients here on Upwork.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.760
Specifically, my
proposals are not designed

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.720
to be deal closers.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.720
In other words, I'm
not trying to get hired

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.690
off my proposal alone.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.690
Rather, my proposals are
designed to start a conversation

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.080
and then hopefully get a
response from the client.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.990
And assuming all goes well,

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.180
I will then go into further
discussion with them

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.240
about the project.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.640
I liked this approach
for a couple of reasons.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.460
One is that I can't really know

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.270
if the project is a good
fit for me and vice versa

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.320
until I talk to the client.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.600
So it wouldn't make sense
for me to go into a hard sell

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.650
where I try to get hired
right there in my proposal

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.360
when what I really need to do

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.370
is to explore if there's even a good fit.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.560
And the other reason I
liked this approach is that

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.100
it's really a modern approach in that

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.630
I'm able to keep my proposals

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.120
very succinct, very streamlined,

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.170
which works nicely

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.400
with those conditions we discussed earlier

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.500
of clients being busier than ever,

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.780
having more choices than
ever before and so on.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.330
All right, now let's talk about

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.080
the specific elements
of a winning proposal.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.490
You can see I've broken it down

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.000
into just three basic elements.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.840
One, a brief introduction.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.670
This is going to be your icebreaker.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.470
Something that draws the client in

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.040
so they read the rest of your proposal.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.160
The second element,

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.720
proof that you can do a
great job for the client.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.610
This is going to be the
real meat of your proposal.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.960
The part that really makes
the client say, "Wow."

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.460
And three, a clear call to action,

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.780
which is a simple way to prompt clients

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.640
to respond to your proposal,

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.890
which again, is the main
goal of my proposals.

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.450
Now, let's dive deeper

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.800
and take an in-depth look at each element

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.760
along with specific examples

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.740
and guidelines for how
to put them into action.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.500
We'll start naturally
with the first element,

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.630
a brief introduction.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.070
First, let's break down

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.560
the goals of your brief introduction.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.560
So of course,

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.600
we wanna get the client
attention, very important,

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.400
but we also wanna start building rapport.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.890
We're really trying to make a connection.

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.640
And finally, and this
is an underrated one,

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.530
we wanna show the client
we read their job post

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.070
because a lot of freelancers,

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.230
believe it or not, don't do that.

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.680
They may copy and paste
the generic proposal

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.580
that really has little or nothing to do

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.640
with the client's actual job posts.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.300
And the client is going to
wonder whether the freelancer

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.870
even read the job post before applying.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.600
And in many cases, it
seems like they did not.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.870
So showing the client you read their posts

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.880
is a small gesture that
can actually go a long way.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.440
So those are the main goals
we're trying to squeeze

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.870
out of this brief introduction.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.550
And I've got a couple of simple,

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.200
elegant ways to do that

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.700
that only take a few seconds to implement.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.610
Okay, so the first is something I call

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.270
the personal connection introduction.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.400
I'll show you examples in just a second,

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.380
but basically, the personal
connection introduction

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.580
is a spontaneous statement

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.320
that's unique to the client or situation.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.100
Think of it as a kind
of conversation starter.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.120
For example, it can be
a genuine compliment,

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.580
a statement of empathy,

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.860
talking about something you have in common

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.350
or really anything along those lines.

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.580
Here you can see some real examples.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.720
The first one is from a proposal

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.760
where I was responding to a job post

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.000
from a client who was about
to do a product launch.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.510
The second one was shown to me on LinkedIn

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.220
by an IT professional,

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:15.590
who was writing to a client

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.850
whose website had
unfortunately been hacked.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:21.410
And the third one is my standard intro

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:24.670
whenever I'm responding to
a job invite from a client.

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:27.210
Notice how these are really
brief and straightforward

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:28.640
yet they do work quite well.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.520
Now, sometimes there
just isn't an opportunity

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.940
to use the personal
connection introduction

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.290
because not every job
post is conducive to it.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.123
When that's the case,

00:07:38.123 --> 00:07:40.830
I have another go-to intro I like to use.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.330
I call this the affirmation approach.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.400
The affirmation approach is even simpler

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.820
because you basically just repeat back

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.700
whatever the client said they
needed in their job posts.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.650
In addition to being simple and easy,

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:55.090
it takes just about 10 seconds to do.

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:57.510
It's also universally applicable.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:58.930
Unlike the personal connection,

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.300
you can use it in any situation.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.400
It's not quite as powerful as
the personal connection intro,

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.260
but it is a solid backup.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.140
Okay, now here you can see some examples

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.597
of the affirmation approach in action.

00:08:10.597 --> 00:08:13.250
"Hi, I see you're looking
for a developer proficient

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.240
in Ruby on Rails and AngularJS

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.687
to complete an existing project."

00:08:17.687 --> 00:08:19.610
"Hi, I see you're looking for an editor

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.677
to tighten up your manuscript."

00:08:21.677 --> 00:08:25.180
"Hi, I see you need help
setting up Zapier automations."

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:26.540
Again, as you can see,

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.940
this is a very straightforward approach,

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.403
yet it doesn't work well.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.050
Okay, let's walk through
some quick guidelines

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:37.140
to help you when you're writing
your brief introduction.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:38.880
As you can see from my examples,

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.170
I generally try to keep
my introductions short.

00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:43.680
I keep it simple.

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.803
And it's also important
not to try too hard.

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:51.150
Sometimes I'll see freelancers
try to use these approaches

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:53.130
and they get too fancy with it.

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:55.540
For example, they may try to force

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.440
some sort of personal connection

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.040
when there really isn't
an opportunity for it.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:05.040
And it can come off as
unnatural or worse disingenuous.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.590
I also sometimes see
people try to get too fancy

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:09.330
with their affirmation approach.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.360
For example, they may go too far

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.320
and put words in the client's mouth,

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.600
instead of just pretty much repeating back

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.600
what the client has asked for.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.170
Another thing I'll sometimes see is

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:22.060
people trying to combine
these two approaches.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.560
And that just doesn't work either.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.730
So remember to keep it simple.

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:26.630
Okay, let's move on

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:29.570
to the second element
of a winning proposal,

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:31.890
proof you can do a great job.

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.040
The best, most effective way I know

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.220
of to do that is to show clients

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:39.380
one or more relevant examples of your work

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.380
right in your proposal.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.100
Showing an example of relevant work

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:46.060
is so powerful for several reasons.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.960
First of all, it instantly shows off

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.980
your skills in a tangible way

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.810
compared to simply telling the client

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.090
that you're qualified
to work on their job.

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:57.470
It also alleviates one of
the client's biggest concerns

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.150
because clients are always wondering,

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.750
can this freelancer do a good
job, not just on any project,

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.720
but on my project in particular?

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.060
And so when you show them
an example of your work

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.420
that's relevant to their needs
or similar to what they need,

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:14.020
it's almost like letting
them look into a crystal ball

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:15.410
and predict the future

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:17.760
because they can see
the results you achieved

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.870
on a similar piece of work.

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:22.770
And finally, showing a
relevant example of work

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:26.500
helps you stand out
because in my experience,

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.620
most freelancers don't do it.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.660
So the client will really appreciate

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:33.220
seeing that relevant
work example from you,

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.260
especially if they've already read through

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.780
a bunch of proposals
that did not contain one.

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.340
Now, sometimes when I
talk about this subject,

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.350
people will put up a little protest.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:43.183
They'll say,

00:10:43.183 --> 00:10:44.740
"But Danny, I'm new to Upwork

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.700
or I'm new to freelancing altogether

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.640
and I don't have a big
portfolio to work with."

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.750
And to that I say, first of all,

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:52.960
the work you show

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:56.070
does not have to be work you've
done for clients on Upwork.

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:57.640
In fact, it doesn't even have

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.750
to be work you've done for clients at all.

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:02.120
It can be something you did for a friend,

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.510
relative, a nonprofit

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:07.720
or it can even be something
you just did for yourself,

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.740
even something you did for fun

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:11.530
or just something you did for the purpose

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:13.350
of building up your portfolio.

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:15.380
Yes, that is allowed.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:16.900
For example, last year,

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.380
I noticed there were
lots of jobs being posted

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.810
for copywriters who could
write landing pages for apps.

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:25.800
So I looked through my
portfolio and guess what?

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:28.760
I'd never written a landing
page for an app before.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.690
So can you guess what I did?

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.400
I wrote a landing page for an app.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.400
I came up with the idea for an app

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.940
and I wrote some landing
page copy about it.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.350
The app does not actually exist,

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:42.630
at least not outside of my own mind,

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:45.650
but the landing page
copy I wrote is very real

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:48.230
and I used it to get quite a few jobs.

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.990
So this is really something anyone can do

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:54.070
and you do not need a big
portfolio to pull it off.

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.020
Another thing some people will say to me

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.497
regarding showing a relevant
example of work is they'll say,

00:11:59.497 --> 00:12:01.580
"Danny, I can see how this would work

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:04.930
for creative types like
writers or designers,

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:06.520
but I'm neither of those things.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.260
So what should I do?"

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.980
And my answer to that is
I have helped freelancers

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:14.430
in just about every
category of work imaginable

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:16.810
and I have yet to discover a profession

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:19.160
where it is not possible to show clients

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.270
a tangible relevant example of your work.

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:25.230
You can see a few specific
examples on the screen here

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:27.030
and there are many more examples.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.630
I could spend all day
making a list of them,

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:32.920
but this should at least
spark some ideas for you.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.450
So for example,

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:38.040
a social media manager can
show screenshots of posts

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.570
that are relevant to what
a client is looking for.

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:43.580
A marketing professional could
create a marketing funnel

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.470
and show that to clients.

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:47.600
I once saw a lawyer here on Upwork

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.820
who cleverly showed clients examples

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.890
of contracts she'd worked on.

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:55.470
And of course, she removed
any personal info from those,

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:58.410
but clients were able to
physically see her work,

00:12:58.410 --> 00:12:59.960
which was great.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.740
An Excel specialist could do
something similar to that,

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.980
except of course with spreadsheets.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:06.350
A proofreader can show

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:10.080
before and after examples
of their work and on and on.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:13.400
The list of ideas is truly never ending.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.670
So by this point,

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:17.480
hopefully I've convinced
you of the power of showing

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.570
relevant work examples in your proposals.

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:23.580
Now, let's talk about how I do it.

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.870
First of all, I do not just tell clients

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:27.810
to check out my portfolio.

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:30.690
Instead, I actually go ahead and pick out

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:34.660
one to three of my most
relevant examples for them.

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.250
That makes it easier for the client,

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:37.630
which they will appreciate.

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:39.360
And it also makes it more likely

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:43.630
they'll see the specific pieces
of work I want them to see.

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:46.930
I'll usually attach it
to my proposal as a PDF

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:50.020
or if it's something that
makes more sense to link to,

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:52.410
for example, a live blog post,

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:55.100
then I would go ahead
and drop a link to that.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.770
Now, quick side note.

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:59.500
Just make sure you never
link clients to a page

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.300
that they can contact you from

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.480
since that is against
Upwork's terms of use.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.280
And finally, perhaps the
most important guideline

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.980
I can give you is to not

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.480
just drop your work in a client's lap,

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.930
but to explain what
makes the work relevant,

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:17.750
special or unique to the client's needs.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:21.670
I call this process tour guiding
clients through your work.

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:24.000
Okay, here you can see a proposal I wrote

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.120
that got me an excellent
client by the way.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.130
And you can see how

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:30.350
not only did I include a
relevant example of work,

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:34.370
but I actually use a significant
portion of my proposal

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:37.990
to tour guide the client
through that piece of work.

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:40.370
Notice also that I did not just point out

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:42.540
random things about my work,

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:45.470
I kept it highly relevant
to what the client needed,

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:49.740
which was an email series to
help him sell an online course.

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.490
This has some tremendous benefits.

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:55.850
It increases the perceived
value of your work

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:57.500
because guess what?

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.800
This stuff may not be obvious to clients

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.230
when they see your work.

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:03.680
You are a professional at what you do,

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.080
but they probably don't have

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.600
the same knowledge and expertise you do.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.470
And in any case,

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:09.960
clients will appreciate the fact

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.060
that you went out of your way

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:13.120
to highlight some key points for them.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.670
And they'll also be very happy

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:16.080
to see how knowledgeable you are

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.320
about the work they need done.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.990
So tour guiding really
helps you position yourself

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:23.210
as an authority on the work you're doing,

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:26.950
which is a very attractive
quality clients are looking for.

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:30.370
And finally, tour guiding
gives clients a better idea

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:32.920
of the type of work
they can expect from you

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.370
assuming they hire you.

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:37.760
So this really sets you
up for success in terms of

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.483
delivering on their
expectations once you're hired.

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:43.220
Now, once you get used to tour guiding,

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.200
it really becomes second nature.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.100
But in the meantime,

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.160
when you're sitting there
writing your proposal,

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.600
here are some questions
you can ask yourself

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:54.110
that will help you tour guide
clients most effectively.

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:57.730
One, what makes this work
relevant to the client?

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:00.970
Two, what did you learn
from working on it?

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:04.390
Three, what makes it a
quality piece of work?

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:08.580
Four, is there anything that
makes it unique or stand out?

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:11.730
Five, did it achieve any specific result?

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:14.960
And know that this can even
be an intangible result

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.170
like the client loved it so much.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:20.220
They immediately rehired
me for another project.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:24.260
And finally, did someone else
say something good about it?

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.770
If so, you can use that as
a testimonial for your work.

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:28.690
Please keep in mind,

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:32.170
these questions are only intended
to spark your imagination.

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.530
You do not need to answer all of them,

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:37.080
even one or two can work quite well.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.860
Now, with everything I've just told you,

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:42.560
if for whatever reason you
are really truly absolutely

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.910
unable to show a client a
relevant example of your work,

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:48.450
but you honestly believe you are qualified

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:50.470
to work on their project anyway,

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:52.990
I'm going to give you
an alternative strategy

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:55.500
for writing a proposal in that case.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.860
However, please note
that this is not ideal

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.550
though it is something I
may do from time to time.

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:04.640
And so what you can do
in that case is to talk

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.330
about a relevant work experience instead.

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:08.990
Again, it doesn't work as well

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:11.280
and there is a bit of risk involved

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:14.280
because it lacks that glimpse
into the future aspect

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:15.730
we talked about earlier

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:17.880
because the client isn't seeing

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.740
a completed piece of work you've done.

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:21.060
So they really don't know

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:24.300
exactly what to expect
from you if they hire you.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:27.000
So I consider this approach
to be somewhat advanced

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.620
and you should really only use it

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:30.150
if you're extremely confident

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:33.380
that you can do a great job
for the client if hired.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.250
With that said, in the right situations,

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:39.000
it can work quite well and
here are some ways to do it.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.200
You can tell a story about
your previous experience

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.910
or about a relevant piece
of work you've done.

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:47.020
You can talk about a
result you've achieved

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:49.540
or helped someone else
achieve through your work.

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.110
You can use a testimonial

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:53.260
to back up your previous experience.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.280
And these last two bullets.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.680
Now, notice that I've bolded these

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.590
because I think these are really key

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:00.270
if you're going to use this approach

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:03.540
and these are sharing your
knowledge or expertise

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:05.590
and offering one or more

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:08.540
helpful suggestions for
the client's project.

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:09.730
And by that I mean,

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:12.540
preferably specific suggestions

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.900
for their situation and goals.

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.875
And I really liked those last
two bullet points especially

00:18:17.875 --> 00:18:20.300
because they do give some of that glimpse

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.070
into the future aspect to your proposal

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:26.500
because at least clients can
see your thought process,

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.380
how you might approach their job.

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:31.780
You also have a chance to
position yourself as an authority

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:33.900
because when you're sharing your knowledge

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.210
or offering helpful suggestions,

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:39.140
you're not just telling the
client about your experience,

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:40.660
you're also showing them

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.600
that you know what you're talking about.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:43.650
And by the way,

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:45.170
even if you do show a client

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:46.800
a relevant example of your work,

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.390
you can also combine that

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:50.570
with any of the approaches on this screen

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:52.380
to make it even more powerful.

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:55.020
Okay, now here is an example of a proposal

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:56.690
where I use this approach.

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:58.480
In this case, the client wanted someone

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.680
to write a few chatbots
scripts for a car dealership.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.040
Now, I had never written a chatbot script,

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.890
but I am a professional writer.

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:09.230
And I also have some relevant
experience in this area

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:12.190
because I did use to
work at a car dealership.

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:14.510
And one of my duties in that job

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:17.260
was actually doing live
chat with customers

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:18.920
on the dealership's website.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.850
So you can say that I was
sort of a human chatbot.

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:24.610
And so I felt like I
would be a perfect fit.

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:27.650
But of course, since I had
never written a chatbot script,

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:30.330
I did not have any
relevant examples of work

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:31.670
to show the client.

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:36.130
So I decided to talk about my
relevant experience instead.

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:39.280
But notice, I didn't just
say that I had experience,

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:40.810
I still proved it.

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:43.320
And I did that by sharing
my specific knowledge

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.380
and expertise in this area

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:48.190
and by offering a specific suggestion.

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:50.720
So really, even though I
did not show the client

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.100
any kind of relevant work example,

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:54.310
when he reads this,

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:56.930
he's gonna realize that I
have a deep understanding

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:58.800
of what he is trying to accomplish

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.510
and how to make it happen.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:03.730
This proposal did lead me
to getting hired for the job

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:06.170
and I was able to do a
great job for the client,

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:08.120
but it still would have
been a better proposal

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:11.430
if I had been able to include
a relevant example of my work.

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:13.010
Now, one thing that's very cool

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:15.420
about the techniques I've
just shown you is that

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:16.560
in addition to using them

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.000
in your cover letter
portion of your proposals,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.750
you can also use them
when writing your answers

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:24.320
to screening questions as well.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.330
And real quick here,

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:28.100
in case you aren't familiar
with screening questions,

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:29.920
these are questions that you're required

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.090
to answer on some proposals.

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:33.440
When a client posts a job,

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.720
it's up to them whether or not

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.750
to include screening questions.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:38.970
And you can see an
example here on the screen

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:42.193
of what it looks like when a
job posts does include those.

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:45.920
So here is an example of a
type of screening question

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.870
that tends to be fairly common

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:51.020
along with what I consider
to be a very good answer.

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:51.860
And by the way,

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:55.250
this is from a proposal
written by one of my students

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:57.290
who gave me permission to share it.

00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:59.630
And this was a successful proposal,

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:02.210
meaning it resulted in
my student getting hired.

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:03.980
So anyway, as you can see,

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:05.990
the client is asking basically,

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:08.560
do you have experience
with this type of work?

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.350
And then my student
handled it beautifully.

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:13.090
Not by just saying yes,

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:16.610
but also talking specifically
about her experience,

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:17.910
sharing her knowledge,

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:19.970
showing a relevant example of work

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:22.200
and highlighting a specific achievement.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.560
Here's another example

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.220
again, from one of my students

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:27.620
who also ended up being
hired for this job.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:29.590
And this one is a bit different.

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:30.900
You can see that in this case,

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.130
there's a personal
connection introduction,

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:35.840
which is a pretty neat way to
answer a screening question.

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.820
She then shares her knowledge
and shows her expertise

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:41.500
while also highlighting
relevant work experience.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.963
Really excellent stuff.

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:46.100
Okay, moving along.

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:49.550
Let's dig into winning
proposal element number three,

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:51.780
a clear call to action.

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:54.910
A call to action is simply
a way to end your proposal

00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:57.570
in a way that prompts clients to respond.

00:21:57.570 --> 00:21:59.760
So instead of just hoping they'll respond,

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.590
it's better to actually
give them a little nudge

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:05.390
that will make it more likely
that they will respondent.

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:09.140
Now, there are two ways I usually do this.

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:12.000
One, I may ask a question
about the project,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.390
which when done right

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:15.930
will prompt the client
to write back to me.

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:18.080
And the other approach I may use is that

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.740
I may invite the client to a brief call

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.890
to discuss the project further.

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:25.170
Now, this is one of the easier aspects

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:26.840
of writing a winning proposal,

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.730
but there are still a
few important details

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:31.170
to pay attention to in
order to get this right.

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:32.720
First, let's quickly go over

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.740
the benefits of using
a clear call to action.

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:37.420
We've already discussed one of these,

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:39.540
which is simply that
it makes it more likely

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:42.290
clients will respond to you proposals.

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:43.470
But there's more.

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:44.950
If you use a call to action

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:46.410
in the way I'm gonna show you,

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:49.060
you'll also be moving
the conversation forward,

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:51.630
which is exactly where you want it to go.

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:53.410
I hear from a lot of freelancers

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:55.480
who maybe write a good proposal

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:58.050
and may even get some responses,

00:22:58.050 --> 00:22:59.300
but they often tell me that

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.760
the conversation never
seems to go anywhere.

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.700
That's because you need to
move the conversation forward.

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:07.470
You can't just wait and
hope the client will do it.

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:11.520
And a clear call to action is
very helpful in doing that.

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.030
And finally, the two
types of call to action

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:17.550
I just showed you either
asking a clarifying question

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:19.300
or inviting the client to a call

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.580
to discuss the project in more detail.

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:25.400
Notice how they both convey
your interest in the project.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.600
And this is a very good
thing because clients like it

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.750
when you're interested in their project.

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:33.100
In fact, all else being equal,

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.770
the freelancer who shows
the most genuine interest

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:38.810
is the one who's most likely to get hired.

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:41.490
So here you can see a very simple example

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:44.320
of how I successfully put
this approach into action

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.300
by asking a simple, clarifying question

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.020
that the client then
responded to very quickly.

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:50.853
In this case,

00:23:50.853 --> 00:23:53.510
I didn't wanna go straight
for the call because

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:56.130
while I was potentially
interested in this job,

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:58.140
I really needed to know
a little more about it

00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:59.900
before committing to a call.

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:02.060
And again, it ended up
working out very well.

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:03.220
Some quick guidelines

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.390
that can help you with
your calls to action.

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:07.640
First of all, I usually use just

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:11.060
one call to action per proposal.

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:15.300
I either ask a question or
ask for the call. Not both.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:18.050
Similarly, I also usually limit myself

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:20.290
to asking just one question.

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:22.120
Remember, as I mentioned earlier,

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.740
I'm just trying to start a conversation

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:26.290
and I don't wanna overwhelm the client

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:27.880
with tons of questions.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.510
Though some people have told me

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:31.330
they do well with several questions.

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:33.620
So of course, you should always feel free

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:35.740
to go with whatever works best for you.

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:38.270
And don't be afraid to
try different things.

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:40.700
Now, when I do ask clients a question,

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:43.410
I wanna make sure it's
not something arbitrary.

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:45.330
Questions should aim to clarify

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:47.580
one or more aspects of the job.

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:48.810
And I like to make it something

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:51.860
that's fairly easy for
the client to respond to.

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.120
Recall my question from
the previous slide,

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.550
where I simply asked the client

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:57.730
what he was going to be selling.

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:00.030
Okay, so let's just do a quick recap

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:04.010
and take a bird's eye view of
the three elements in action.

00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:07.340
Notice again, how I begin with
a simple brief introduction.

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:09.420
From there, I moved to sharing

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:11.200
a relevant piece of work I've done

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.530
to prove that I can do a great job.

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:16.210
I also tour guide the
client through the work

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:18.460
explaining why it's relevant

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:20.100
and talking about it's key points

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:21.950
that I know he'll be interested in

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:24.160
and that show my expertise.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.670
And of course that highlight
the quality of the work.

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:30.380
Finally, I end with a clear call action,

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.700
in this case, a simple
clarifying question.

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:34.630
Best of all,

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:37.350
this proposal took me just
a few minutes to write

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:40.750
and it resulted in a win for
both myself and the client.

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:42.960
Now, one thing you may have noticed is

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:46.090
what my proposals
generally do not contain.

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:49.610
Specifically, I usually do
not discuss details like

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:51.630
timeline or scheduling.

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:54.250
I generally do not offer to do the work.

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:56.497
For example, some freelancers will say,

00:25:56.497 --> 00:25:58.470
"I can start on this right away."

00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:00.530
I don't that because I don't really know

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:02.920
if there's a good fit yet at this point.

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.160
I mean, I may suspect there's a good fit,

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.900
but I don't really know until
after I talked to the client.

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:09.270
So I'm not going to go into

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:11.630
nitty-gritty details about scheduling

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:15.550
and other kinds of fine
print items in my proposal.

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:17.890
And this has a secondary benefit

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:20.220
of keeping my proposal succinct.

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:23.090
They've got stuff in
there that clients love

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:25.650
without bogging them down with details

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:27.740
in this preliminary phase.

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:31.210
Once I get clients on a call,
if I feel there's a good fit,

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:33.100
then we discuss the fine print
